# CasesMediaQueryes 
Repository oriented to studies of uses of media queryes. 
Currently, many developers use the following standards in their projects:<br>
<pre>
  @media(min-width: 768px){code here{..}}
</pre>
or
<pre>
  @media(min-width: 48em){code here{..}}
</pre>
<p>
  But in addition to these measures shown above, it is also possible to use other fixed as vw, rem, vwmin and vmax. For a long time, I have been studying use cases of media queryes where simulei several situations on smaller screens and larger, I've had success and failures of some attempts.
